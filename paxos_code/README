### Setup instructions

To compile all executables, simply execute
`$ make all` in the home directory. This creates
three binaries in the `bin/` directory, one for
each demonstration of Paxos, as well as a testing
program in `tests/`.


You can also find text files of example output in the `doc/`
folder.
